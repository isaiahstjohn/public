This repository is a catch all for anything in `/home` that I want to 
be public. I like to work in the open, so that's just about everything.
You'll find notes, config files, experiments, quick and 
dirty scripts, and half-finished projects. Nothing is maintained.
But if you do find something useful here, I'd love to hear about it.
Maybe I'll even upgrade it to a proper project.
